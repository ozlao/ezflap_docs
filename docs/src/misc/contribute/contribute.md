# Contribute
There are several ways to contribute to ezFlap:
 * Participate in the development in the [ezflap repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap).
   * If you plan to develop a new feature (or a new Transformer!) - it's best to open an issue first, share your plan,
     and receive feedback.
 * Add ezFlap Core Widgets in the [ezflap_widgets repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_widgets).
 * Report bugs in [ezflap Issues](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap/issues).
 * Improve this guide in the [ezflap_docs repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_docs).

If you decide to get involved with the development, please:
 * Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
 * Make sure that all tests pass:
   * `ezflap` tests ([Repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap)).
   * `ezflap_tests` tests ([Repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_tests)).
   * `ezflap_widgets` tests ([Repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_widgets)).
   * `ezflap_docs` tests ([Repository](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_docs)).
 * Follow the ezFlap code style. Most importantly:
   * Use tabs.
   * Don't pass the code through `dartfmt`.
